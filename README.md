* LINQ_4.cs  LINQ Query
  * The following example shows how the 
three parts of a query operation are expressed 
in source code. The example uses a collection Student as a data source.

* ForLoop.cs  Simple Parallelism.For Loop
  * This program execute the same code in serial mode and with parallel for loop threads.
As is normal to wait, the result of time is less in part ParallelFor because different threads  
calculate the multiplication in each iteration.
In serial part the time is big because the same thread have to calculate the multiplication in each iteration.

* Threads_PerfectNumber.cs with threads
  * This program calculate the fuction PerfectNumber showing the time that spent in this calculationin each threads

* Tasks_PerfectNumber.cs with tasks
  * This program calculate the fuction PerfectNumber showing the time that spent in this calculation in each threads or task

* Program3threads.cs multithreads

* ParallelFor_PerfectNumber.cs  Parallelism.For Loop
  * This program calculate the fuction PerfectNumber showing the time that spent in this calculation in normal for loop and in parallel for loop

* countries.cs 
  * This program obtain the Data Base from a file named data.csv and keep this information in 
IEnumerable Countries. After this the program does a LINQ Query where show the countries with density higher to 100 of a Continent (that we add like first parameter). Finally this program show the total of Countries that pass this condition instead of this Continent, and information about 
this Counties like Name of the country, Population of this country, Area and Density

* countries2.cs
  * This program obtain the Data Base from a file 
named data.csv and keep this information in 
IEnumerable Countries. After this the program does 
a LINQ Query where show the countries with density 
higher to of a Continent (that we add like first 
parameter ). Finally this program show the total of Countries that pass this condition instead of this Continent, and information about this Counties like Name of the country, Population of this country, Area and Density
